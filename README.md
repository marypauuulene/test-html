To use GitHub Pages for hosting a simple HTML animation, follow these steps:

Create a new repository: If you don’t already have a GitHub account, sign up for one. Then, create a new repository by clicking on the “+” icon in the top right corner of the GitHub homepage and selecting “New repository”.

Name your repository: Give your repository a name, such as “my-animation”, and add a description if you like.

Choose your repository settings: Select “Public” for the repository visibility and choose a license if you want to include one. You can also choose to initialize the repository with a README file, but this is optional.

Upload your HTML animation files: Click on the “Add file” button and select “Upload files”. Drag and drop your HTML animation files, such as your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, into the upload area.

Enable GitHub Pages: Once your files are uploaded, go to the “Settings” tab of your repository and scroll down to the “GitHub Pages” section. Under “Source”, select “Main” or “Master” as your branch and click “Save”.

View your HTML animation: GitHub Pages will now generate a URL for your repository, which you can use to view your HTML animation in a web browser. The URL will be in the format https://.github.io//.

That’s it! Your HTML animation should now be hosted on GitHub Pages and accessible via the generated URL. Note that it may take a few minutes for the URL to become active after enabling GitHub Pages.

If you can only see the README file on your GitHub Pages deployment, it is likely because you have not configured your repository correctly to serve your HTML files as a website. Here are the steps to set up your GitHub Pages deployment:

Ensure that you have an index.html file in your repository’s root directory. This file should contain the HTML and CSS code for your animated birthday card.

Navigate to the repository settings on GitHub and click on the “Pages” tab.

Under the “Source” section, select the branch containing your HTML and CSS files. If you have your files in the master branch, select that branch.

Click “Save” to save the changes.

Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your website.

Once the deployment is complete, you can access your website by visiting the URL that is shown in the “Your site is published at” section of the GitHub Pages settings.

If you have followed these steps and still cannot see your animated birthday card on your GitHub Pages deployment, double-check that your HTML and CSS files are in the correct location and that your HTML file is named “index.html”. Additionally, ensure that your HTML code is valid and free of errors.
